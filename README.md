# Unwanted Intro

Unwanted is a tool enabling blockchain users to clear their wallets of unwanted digital assets. Users are able to transfer tokens out of their wallets to either an [EVM Zero Address ](https://ethereum.org/sw/glossary/#zero-address)or an address they choose. In addition, users are capable of "airdropping" a single token to batches of externally owned accounts. Ultimately, the Unwanted app facilitates transferring of ERC20 & ERC721 tokens in batches saving user network fees and time.

# Connect A Wallet

{% hint style="info" %}
**Make sure you have Web3 enabled:** If you've been on the blockchain or are new to using it, you must have heard of something called Web3. Web3 is a library of software that enables your browser to connect to the blockchain. In order for Unwanted to work, you will need to connect your wallet via a Web3 provider. Common Web3 providers include Metamask, Coinbase, Trustwallet, or WalletConnect. Please make sure to install one of these into your browser before trying to use Unwanted.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

If you do not have a Wallet provider installed please visit [Create A Wallet](create-a-wallet.md)

After confirming that you are connected to a Web3 provider you are pretty much ready to start using Unwanted.&#x20;

You may connect to Unwanted using the Connect Button located on the top right of the application.

{% hint style="danger" %}
MAKE SURE THAT YOU ONLY CONNECT TO THE OFFICIAL UNWANTED APPLICATION TO PREVENT PHISHING SCAMS

# NFTs

## Launch Date - 03/26/2022



## Unwanted NFTs

For a period of time, for every annihilation transaction that happens on Unwanted a uniquely generated NFT will be minted and sent to the transactor's address. These NFTs have several properties spread between several rarities giving each NFT limited-edition value.

These NFTs will only be allowed to be minted for a limited period and will focus on showcasing the artist's aesthetics and their artwork.&#x20;

Each season will have a new theme of NFTs released based on the artist currently showcasing.  Unwanted allows users to submit requests to have their NFT art be minted from the use of the blackhole.

Holding Unwanted NFT grants you **Wanted Status** which increases the chance to gain extra NFTs per action, discounts, and other exclusive privileges.&#x20;

Annihilation is the only way to earn an Unwanted NFT;  however, when annihilating **any NFT, you get an Unwanted NFT back.**

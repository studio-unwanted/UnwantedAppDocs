# How To Transfer

Unwanted makes it easy to click and add tokens to the transfer queue. Head over to the Hyperloop and you'll see a familiar interface for selecting and adding tokens to the queue.

{% hint style="info" %}
To transfer multiple different tokens at once, you will have to approve each one of them for transfer. However, you will only need to initiate one transaction that will actually send all of the assets.

### Add Tokens Or NFTs To The Queue

Click on an asset and it will bring up a modal asking you to add the asset to the queue.

Within this modal, you will be able to see brief information about the token as well as the ability to enter the amount of the token you want to send. **Values must be positive, greater than zero, and within the range of your balance.**

Enter or select a value you want to transfer and continue by clicking `Add Token` (or NFT)

### Approve & Initiate

Finally, enter a valid public address to send the assets to and approve the Hyperloop to send the asset.&#x20;

The application will bring up your Web3 provider to ask you to approve each token. **After each token is approved and a valid public address is entered, the button to initiate the multi-transfer will enable allowing you to send the transaction.**

### Verify

When the transaction is sent, the application will present you with a confirmation and an explorer hash to verify the transaction.

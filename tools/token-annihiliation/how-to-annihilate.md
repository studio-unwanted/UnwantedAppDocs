Within this modal, you will be able to see brief information about the token as well as the ability to enter the amount of the token you want to send. **Values must be positive, greater than zero, and within the range of your balance.**

Enter or select a value you want to transfer and continue by clicking `Add Token` (or NFT)

### Approve & Initiate

Finally, enter a valid public address to send the assets to and approve the Hyperloop to send the asset.&#x20;

The application will bring up your Web3 provider to ask you to approve each token. **After each token is approved and a valid public address is entered, the button to initiate the multi-transfer will enable allowing you to send the transaction.**

### Verify

When the transaction is sent, the application will present you with a confirmation and an explorer hash to verify the transaction.

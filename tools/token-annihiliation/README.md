# Token Annihiliation

## The Unwanted Blackhole

Annihilating tokens is the act of approving Unwanted to initiate a transaction to send one or more ERC20, or ERC721 and equal tokens into an EVM Zero Address. An EVM Zero Address is a special address that was created during the Genesis Block.&#x20;

The Genesis block is a special block that was mined by the EVM itself and therefore is associated with the account `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`. It's impossible to generate the private key for this address and **people can use it as a proof-of-burn account on EVM blockchains.** This essentially _casts_ the tokens away making them unretrievable forever.

Unwanted chose to use **GENESIS 08** for Annihilation.

Address: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000008`

[https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000008](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000008)

This address exists on all EVM Based Blockchains
